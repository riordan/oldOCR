Elyside Ave. (also Twenty-ninth Ave. at this point), between (15th
and 16th Streets) 155th and 156th Streets, showing in a set of four views
the Halter Home house and its out-buildings. One, Bedell, states that
t Revolutionary ï¬‚ax- hurying place was northeast of the house, to which,
55 years ago, necessitated the crossing of the stone wall seen in the
background of No. 4, at the large Buttonball tree, the stump of which
remains today. At that time, flat stones used as markers were still
standing; they mvlng been obliterated when the orchard was removed by
the wagons. Members of the Bcwne family (5rd generation since the War)
mentioned the Burial Ground and Spring and Water Bay to him. However,
Eugene L. Ambruster states that it was on the line of old 17th (now
157th) Street. For more data, see, other views.
