Irving Place, east side, from 14th to 15th streets, showing the
Academy of Music, with the Consolidated Gas offices at 4 Irving Place,
on the S.E. corner of 15th Street. 2 Irving Place used to be
(around 1880) the home of the Lotus Club.

The Academy of Music, originally intended as a permanent home for
Italian Opera, was opened on this site in October, 1854, with a
production of "Norma". Qie of the notable performances in the old
huilning was a concert at which Jenny Lind Seng. On October 12,
1860, a grand ball was given here for Edwaxd (the future Edward Vll),
Prince of Wales, on the occasion of his visit to New York during
his tour of North America.

The original Academy of lmsic, on this site, was burned May 22, 1666;
and the building pictured here was opened the following Februaxy.
In 1887 the Academy Company oeciced not to compete further with the
new and fashionable metropolitan Opera House, and accordingly sold
this building, after which it became a dramatic house.

As a legitimate theatre it was famous, among other things, for the
phenomenal run of "The old Homestead", from August 30, 1888 to May,
1891. The elder sothern and others also played for long runs.

0n the afternoon of November 18, l919, the Prince of Wales, grandson
of Edward V11, will pay the Academy a visit. By that time it will
have become a motion picture house. Finally in 1926, it will be
demolished; and the ground under it will become part of the site of
the new Consolidated Gas Building.
