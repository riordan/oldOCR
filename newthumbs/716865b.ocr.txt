Breed Street, north from a point between Beever St.
and Exuhenge Place, and across the letter to Wall Street.
Both of these views shoe the curb market that operate!
here below Exchange Place. To the left are a number of
prominent structures, that are progressively, the John-
Iten, Blair, Meekey, N. Y. Stock Exchange, Wilke, Gillen-
den and Hanover Trust Buildings. View 2 is identical,
with the exception of the obvious replacement or the Oil-
lenden by the Bankers Trust Bldg. Note the glimpse of
the U. S. Sub Treasury shown.

No. 1: April 1906
