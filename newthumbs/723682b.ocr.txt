erected around 1900 on the site of six old houses. The building
from 9th to 10th Streets, marked "F01 sale" in the 1913 View, is
at least ten years older; and the one on the N.W. corner of 10th
Street looks like about 1880. The former will be xeplaced by a
lz—stoxy apartment house, and the latter, together with the 4—
story house adjoining it, by an ll—story apartment house, in both
cases prior to 1930.
