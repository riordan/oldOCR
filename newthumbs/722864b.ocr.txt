Riverside Park: An aerial view northward from a point over West 72nd
Street (southern extremity of Park area) showing: the appearance of this
marginal strip after completion of the nest Side Improvement Project.

The railroad tracks have been enclosed by a viaduct, the roof of which
carries automotive traffic northward from the West Side Express Highway
(immediate foregrounÔ¨Å) to the Henry Hudson Parkway and thereby relieves
the congestion that formerly existed on the Drive (eastern side of Park,
buildings thereon). Note the shoreline and the landscaping thereon.
This photograph was published on October 12, 1957 by the Department of
Parks in comparison to a earlier View (north from West 79th Street) taken
in the Fan of 1954. This brochure was titled "The west side Improvement

Project ."
