Cherokee Place, north from East 76th to 78th Street's.
This abort thoroughfare forms the westerly boundary of
the diminutive John Jay Park, portions of which appear
on the right. At the left margin is a municipal bath
house serving this neighborhood. Above are several
apartment houses erected a number or years ago as an
experiment in social reform.
